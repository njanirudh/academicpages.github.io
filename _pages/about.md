* I am a Masters student studying Autonomous Systems in the [Computer Science Department](https://www.h-brs.de/en/inf/study/master/autonomous-systems) at [Hochschule Bonn](https://mas-group.inf.h-brs.de/?page_id=23). [[Curriculum Vitae](https://njanirudh.github.io/files/Anirudh_NJ_CV.pdf)]
* I have experience in undertaking both research based projects in academic settings and customer facing applications in a fast startup environment. My interests lie mainly in Robotics, especially learning algorithms for Perception and Manipulation subsystems. 
* My hobbies include playing music instruments, programming, drawing...other random stuff.
